title: GIT 101 and Additional Resources
---

There are countless articles and resources on GIT, but here I want to write down the basic commands for working in an existing repository to help me remember them, along with a handful of links I found most helpful.  In the beginning, I will most likely have to reference and copy and paste from here often until it becomes rote.  Another useful resource I found was [Explainshell](https://explainshell.com/) for quick descriptions about what each piece of a git command is doing.

## First Commands Used in Class

### From Ruby Koans:
```
git add -A; git commit -m "Note-to-Self"
```

Breaking down what this means:
 - `git add -A` => adds all files that have been modified to the index. I am sure its more nuanced than this, but for now this definition should be good enough for me to come back to.
 - `git commit` => records the changes to the repositary
 - `git commit -m "Note-to-Self"` => with the commit, we are passing along a message to myself to remind myslef what I did when making these changes.

### From Excercism:
```
git checkout branch-name
```
If your repository has multiple branches, this command let's us switch between branches

```
git checkout -b name-of-new-branch
```
The `checkout -b` creates a new branch, and it is followed `name-of-new-branch`, or what we want the branches name to be.
