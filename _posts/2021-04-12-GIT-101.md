title: GIT 101 and Additional Resources
---

There are countless articles and resources on GIT, but here I want to write down the basic commands for working in an existing repository to help me remember them, along with a handful of links I found most helpful.  In the beginning, I will most likely have to reference and copy and paste from here often until it becomes rote.  Another useful resource I found was [Explainshell](https://explainshell.com/) for quick descriptions about what each piece of a git command is doing.

### First Commands Used in Class

From Ruby Koans:
```
git add -A; git commit -m "Completed koan"
```

Breaking down what this means:
 - "git add -A" means to to add all files that have been modified to the index. I am sure its more nuanced than this, but for now this definition should be good enough for me to come back to.
 - "git commit" means to record the changes to the repositary
 - "git commit -m "Note to Self" means that with the commit, we are passing along a message to myself to remind myslef what I did when making these changes.

From Excercism:
