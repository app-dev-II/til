# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first Markdown blog post.

Will this post be practical, _probably not!_

Using backticks will be useful for using code snippets.

```ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :first_name
  attr_accessor :last_name

  def full_name
    return self.first_name + " " + self.last_name
  end
end
```

```
\```ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :first_name
  attr_accessor :last_name

  def full_name
    return self.first_name + " " + self.last_name
  end
end
\```
```

Also, it helps to escape special characters with backslashes (not _underlined_ vs. not \_underlined\_)
```
(not _underlined_ vs. not \_underlined\_)

## Heading Level 2
The number of # determine the level of header 1=#, 2=##, etc.

## Adding Links (Also a Heading Level 2)
When referencing articles put them in square brackets, followed by the link:

### Other Links (Heading Level 3)
These links will be my best friends this quarter!

(Also, this is how to format number lists.  Space + Number + . + Space + List_Item)
